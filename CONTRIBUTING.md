## How to contribute resources to devRoadMap

The way it works is simple, but initially complicated. It works like a linked list, each primary object holds a reference to the next primary object.

It is designed thus:

primary object
```
|
|_ title
|_ options: array of
    |_ id
    |_ title
    |_ more_info
    |_ link (optional): only if option is a link
|_ next
```

The `id` of the options array in previous primary object is used as an identifier for a secondary object in the next primary object. Confusing?

For example

```js
const jsonObj = {
  "primary": {
    "title": "Learn a programming language",
    "options": [
      {
        "id": "python",
        "title": "Learn Python", // what displays as the option
        "more_info": "Python is a very popular language, so learn it" // a tooltip that explains the option
      },
      {
        "id": "JavaScript",
        "title": "Learn JavaScript",
        "more_info": "JavaScript is for the web, so learn it" // recommending languages shouldn't be like this; just an example
      }
    ],
    "next": "step2:resources" // specify steps to track
  },
  "step2:resources": {
    "javascript": {
      "title": "Resources to learn JavaScript",
      "order": true, // displays the options below in order, with the first being step 1, and next step 2...
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "freecodecamp",
          "title": "FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Course",
          "link": "https://freecodecamp.org",
          "more_info": "More information about the course"
        },
        {
          "id": "codecademy",
          "title": "Codecademy Intermediate Course",
          "link": "https://codecademy.org",
          "more_info": "More information about the course"
        }
      ]
    },
    "python": {
      "title": "Resources to learn Python"
      // ... repeat the same structure above
    }
  }
}
```


### Explanation

What this shows is that, initially a paragraph of "Learn a programming language" and options as a list will come up (python, JavaScript).
When "JavaScript" is clicked for example, a list of ordered options (with links) of "FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Course" and "Codecademy Intermediate Course" will pop up.

This is possible because we told the "primary" object to redirect to "step2:resources" object. And this "step2:resources" has turned the options of "primary" object into an object with a key of their id (when in option).

I hope this is clear.
